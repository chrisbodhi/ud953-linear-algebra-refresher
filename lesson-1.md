## Points
- represent location
- written as `(x, y, z...)`
- two equal only if position is the same

## Vectors
- represent change in location
- magnitude and direction
- written as `[x, y, z...]`
- two equal if same magnitude and direction, but not necessarily same position

Can conflate the two if vector starts from the origin; can be a useful mental shortcut
